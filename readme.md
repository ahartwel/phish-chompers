## What is it

An app to listen to and download live Phish shows. It uses the http://phish.in/ api to find and serve shows.

## Contributing

The general architecture is documented in this [repo](https://github.com/ahartwel/What-Does-The-New-York-Times-Think-Of-)

- Make a branch (eg. 'feature/cool-new-feature', 'bug/awesome-bug-fix')
- Write some code and write some tests (be better about testing than I've been, add some tests to existing code if you feel like being awesome)
- Try not to add any warnings to the build, SwiftLint is in the project, try to follow the rules set up, feel free to offer suggestions for changes to the styling rules.)
- Make a pull request, the project will be built and tests will be run on Bitrise. 
- Help fillout this readme with anything you think others will find helpful.
